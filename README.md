# Snap Lounge

During my time as an engineering scholar at Snapchat I collaborated with design, story telling, and engineer scholars to create a socially conscious app called Snap Lounge. We chose to tackle the stigma of mental health. Because there is a lack of accessible resources for individuals to learn more about what mental health is and why it is so important. Snap Lounge solves this issue using 3 key components personalized bitmojis, memes, and surveys. We choose these features because they keep our audience engaged and excited.
